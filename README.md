Create a <p> with red text that says "Hey I’m red!" and add it to the document’s body
Create and add an <h3> with blue text that says "I’m a blue h3!"
Create and add a <div> with a black border and pink background color with the following elements inside of it:
another <h1> that says "I’m in a div"
a <p> that says "ME TOO!"
Hint for this one: after creating the div with createElement, append the <h1> and <p> to it before adding it to the document.body.
